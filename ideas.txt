Events
-------
Toxic cloud/rain causes wells to stop producing.
Bulk water storage gets a leak, once bulk storage is a thing.

Water Sources
-------------
Not-improvised well.
Condensers.
Rainfall collection.
Melt snow.
Get some water from food?
Desalination plant, if salt water ever becomes a thing.

Mechanics
---------
PRISONERS AND THE SICK NEED TO DRINK.  Jobs to give water to others :(
ANIMALS NEED TO DRINK.  Update the animal thinktree.
Custom CompWaterDrinker on some animals eg camels.
Animals that aren't pets leave the map when they get too thirsty -- simulates a search for water, and stops too much death :P
Reduced water need while asleep.
Water need depends on temperature, sun exposure, maybe current job?
Plants need watering?
Salt water.  The map generator for beaches would spawn salt water instead of fresh water, not drinkable without desalination.
Bulk water storage.  Pumps?
Digging canals?  Water in lakes (not edge-connected) eventually runs out if you canal too much?  Seems tricky...

Health
------
Drinking from terrain water and improvised wells can cause sickness.  Water treatment plants?  Seems like overkill.

Apparel
-------
Still-suits!
