Events
-------
Toxic cloud/rain causes wells to stop producing.
Bulk water storage gets a leak, once bulk storage is a thing.

Water Sources
-------------
Not-improvised well.
Condensers.
Rainfall collection.
Melt snow.
Get some water from food?
Desalination plant, if salt water ever becomes a thing.

Mechanics
---------
INJURED PRISONERS AND COLONISTS NEED TO DRINK.  Jobs to give water to others.
Custom CompWaterDrinker on some animals eg camels.
Animals should probably have a wider water search radius, and remember where they drank from in the past.
Reduced water need while asleep.
Water need depends on temperature, sun exposure, maybe current job?
Plants need watering?
Salt water.  The map generator for beaches would spawn salt water instead of fresh water, not drinkable without desalination.
Bulk water storage.  Pumps?
Digging canals?  Water in lakes (not edge-connected) eventually runs out if you canal too much?  Seems tricky...

Health
------
Drinking from terrain water and improvised wells can cause sickness.  Water treatment plants?  Seems like overkill.

Apparel
-------
Still-suits!

Misc
-----
Generic def injector?
