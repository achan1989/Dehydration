Events
-------
Toxic cloud/rain causes wells and cisterns to stop producing.

Water Sources
-------------
Condensers?
Melt snow?
Desalination plant, if salt water ever becomes a thing.

Mechanics
---------
Fix errors to do with ThinkNodes when a save game is loaded.  "Animal could not find ThinkNode with save key n."  and  "Animalnnnn with job Dehydration_DrinkJob A=(110,0,98) tried to get curToilIndex=7 but only has 5 toils"
Replace hard-coded tick numbers with ones based off GenTicks and GenDate
Water containers leak when damaged.
Custom CompWaterDrinker on some animals eg camels.
Animals should probably have a wider water search radius, and remember where they drank from in the past.
Water need depends on temperature, sun exposure, maybe current job?
Faster firefighting with water buckets.
Nicer non-instant toils.  Effects should happen over time or at the end -- better than instantly at the start and then standing around doing "nothing" for a while.
Salt water.  The map generator for beaches would spawn salt water instead of fresh water, not drinkable without desalination.
Water network, like electricity?
Digging canals?  Water in lakes (not edge-connected) eventually runs out if you canal too much?  Seems tricky...

Health
------
Drinking from terrain water and improvised wells can cause sickness.  Water treatment plants?  Seems like overkill.

Apparel
-------
Still-suits!

Misc
-----
Bathtub as joy item.
Generic def injector?
